## qwinters = Quinn Winters

Hi! I'm Quinn Winters, but a lot of people just call me qwinters. I'm a mathematics student at TU Munich. I am broadly interested in functional analysis,  geometric analysis, and their interplay. Currently I'm reading a lot of Optimal Transport theory. 

#### On this blog...

On this blog you'll find random mathematical and non-mathematical thoughts. You can also find my [coursework](./coursework.md). 

#### Before TUM..

I spent some time at [Palantir Technologies](https://palantir.com) as an Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) working across commercial and government sectors in New York NY, Washington DC, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and London. Traveling was a blast and I got to learn a little bit of Arabic along the way. 

I did my undergraduate degree at [Case Western Reserve University in Mathematics](https://mathstats.case.edu). The mathematics department at CWRU is fantastic! 

#### Outside of mathematics...

Other than mathematics, I'm a magician and helping lead the [TUM Zauberer](https://tumzauberer.club) meetup.
