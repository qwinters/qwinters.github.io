## Mathematical bibliograpphy: books edition

I was inspried by the list presented in the [Chicago undergraduate mathematics bibliography](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~abhishek/chicmath.htm)
to give some serious thought as to the books that I think are important to read in my career and those that will help me get from being a student of
mathematics to a working mathematician. 

Here are a list of books that I am planning to read to give myself such a proper background. Note that these are independent of and in addition to 
readings for individual courses. I have sorted the list into three basic sections: "problem books" which are books that I am reading to improve my 
problem solving and to practice exercises; "foundations" which are books about the foundations of analysis, stochastics, and other topics I am purusing, 
and "research topics" which are generally monographs or research level books to help guide myself into understanding the current topics in reserach. 
There is sometimes significant bleed through between the categories. 

### Problem books 
* Calculus on manifolds (Spivak)
* Principles of mathematical analysis (Rudin) 
* How to solve it (Polya)
* Problems and theorems in analysis I and II (Polya) 
* Ordinary differential equations (Arnold)
* Problems in Real and Functional Analysis (Torchinsky) 
  
### Foundations
* Analysis (Lieb and Loss) 
* Fourier Analysis (Stein and Sharkarchi) 
* Complex Analysis (Stein and Sharkarchi) 
* Real Analysis (Stein and Sharkarchi) 
* Functional Analysis (Stein and Sharkarchi) 
* Probability: Theory and Examples (Durrett)
* Measure theory and fine properties of functions (Evans) 
* Partial differential equations (Evans) 
* Linear Operators (Dunford and Schwartz)
* Convex Functional Analysis (Kurdila and Zabarankin)

### Research topics
* Optimal Transport for Applied Mathematicians (Santambrogio) 
* Topics in Optimal Transport (Villani) 
* Gradient Flows in Metric Spaces and in the Space of Probability Measures (Ambrosio, Gigli and Savare)
* The Concentration of Measure Phenomenon (Ledoux)
* Mean Curvatrue Flow and Isoperimetric Inequalities (Ritore and Sinestrari) 
* Functional Inequalities: New Perspectives and New Applications (Ghoussoub Moradifam)
* Asymptotic Geometric Analysis Parts I and II (Arstein-Avidan, Giannopoulos, and Milman)
* Maximal Function Methods for Sobolev Spaces (Kinnunen, Lehrbaeck, and Vaehaekangas)
