# Mathematics workflow

I find that studying for mathematics at a high level (e.g. masters level and above) is a little difficult because it's
often hard to figure out how to really study: you want to focus on conceptual issues and problem solving, but if you're 
beyond the point of using undergraduate or graduate level textbooks with regular exercises and practice problems, then
how should you study?

Here's my general workflow for studying + note taking. The tools that I use in particular (but you don't have to use 
these to be successful):
- Laptop + Vim (see [dotfiles](https://qwinters.me/dotfiles) for Vim configuration)
- iPad + Note taking app (I like GoodNotes 5) 
- Paper / Pencil

## During the semester

### Before class:
Read ahead in the reference material to see what is going to be covered next. Write down questions in the margins and 
have bring them to class (e.g. in an organized note). If you don't know what is going to be covered next, just ask the 
professor.

### During class: 
Take notes but with a focus on setting yourself up for exercises later: jot down general strategy + hints + questions
that you have (even ones that you might think are stupid!). I prefer to do this in LaTeX (using Vim) but you can use 
whatever technique you want -- the reason why I prefer LaTeX will come in later

### The day after class: 
Try to reconstruct proofs from memoring and resort to the hints if needed. Also answer the questions you wrote down in 
the notes while you are doing this. If you can't solve something move on to the next one and just power through it. Keep
this quick, but thorough

### Two-three days after class: 
Go back and re-read the results that you wrote in after class. Look for errors, open questions, and try to fill in things
you didn't get on the first time around. Spend your time on this session and focus on accuracy over speed. At the end
of the session make a list of doubts + open questions.

### Two days after that:
Go back again and compare your notes and doubts to the textbook. If you don't understand anything / have substational 
differences, craft an email to the professor / use this time to bring it up with them after class to get a better intuition. 
If you have been able to sit with the concept for several days and still don't see the importance / underlying mechanisms
to the proofs, then probably asking for help is a good move. 

### Do the exercises assigned for homework if applicable
If you have them great, do those throughout the week (breaking up problems into managable chunks). Otherwise skip this
advice (afterall the point of this post is to focus on the times where this isn't available to you). 

## During exam season: 

### Re-read LaTeX notes (which are nicer to read!) 

### Write out question-answer responses

### Solve more practice problems

## Managing all the quesetions and threads that might pop up
