## qwinters = Quinn Winters

Hi! I'm Quinn Winters, but a lot of people just call me "qwinters". I'm a mathematics student at TU Munich. I am broadly interested in functional 
analysis,  geometric analysis, and their interplay. Starting in June 2022 I will be visiting the Institute of Science and Technology Austria for a 
short research stay.

#### Before TUM..

I spent some time at [Palantir Technologies](https://palantir.com) as an Forward Deployed Engineer (FDE) working across commercial and government sectors in New York NY, Washington DC, Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and London. Traveling was a blast and I got to learn a little bit of Arabic along the way. 

I did my undergraduate degree at [Case Western Reserve University in Mathematics](https://mathstats.case.edu). The mathematics department at CWRU is fantastic! 

#### Outside of mathematics...

Other than mathematics, I'm a magician and heping lead the [TUM Zauberer](https://tumzauberer.club) meetup. I also like programming a little and am extremely passionate about open academia/open science. You can find out more about the [dotfiles I use programming here](https://qwinters.me/dotfiles) and checkout some of the work I'm going to templatize LaTeX, Vim, and Website configurations to make sharing easier for students & professionals [here](https://github.com/AcademTeX).
